# [Caribbean Island Hoppers](http://carib.idoestravel.com/)

This is a blog based on the [Ghost.js](http://ghost.org/download) framework, I'm deploying it through Heroku.

Here are the steps to run it locally:

1. Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) - This Ghost requires **Node v0.12.x**
2. Switch into the pirates-blog library and run npm start. 
3. Change the theme or create your blog based on it, for more info look at [Ghost documentation](http://docs.ghost.org/).
